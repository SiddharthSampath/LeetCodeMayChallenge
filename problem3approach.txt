Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

Note:
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.

canConstruct("a", "b") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "aab") -> true

A problem very similar to problem 2. Hash table approach.
Construct a hash table of letters of magazine where the hash table contains the letters which occur in the magazine and their frequency.
Loop through the characters in the ransom note and check if they are present in the hash table.
If they are and the frequency is greater than 0, decrement frequency by 1 and move to the next character.
If not, return False
If the end of the string is reached successfully, return True
